            <div class="Project-descrip"> The purpose of this project was to create a simple business card 
                generator that would be easy to use. The website also features a database, where users can store
                their inputs for later retrieval with a given security key. I primarily worked on the database and 
                helped with the design of the business card page and business card templates. For further information on
                this project, see the video below.
